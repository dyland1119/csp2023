<p> <center>This is a cookie-click game that I made in collaboration with Luca Rosano Doolittle. When you click on the moving cookie, you get a point for clicking it. After you get 20 cookies, you can purchase an automatic cookie clicker that will add 5 cookies for each rotation of the cookie. <br></br> If you have 100 cookies, you can purchase an automatic cookie clicker that will add 10 cookies for each rotation.</p>

<p> <center> This is a game that is based on the classic game "Fruit Ninja" where you cut fruit and get points for it. If you do not hit the fruit, you do not get the points.</p>

<p><center>In this project we searched a system for possible phishing. We also found corrupted files in the fish tank maintenance. We found errors in the magnesium and alkalinity levels, and the temperature was too high. </p>

<p><center> In this project RJ and I selected a simulation to observe and study from NetLogo. We decided on the Lighting simulation. This model showed how lightning works and how the negative ions from the clouds connect with the dust and trees on the ground. We could change the size of the cloud, its strength, the number of trees, and the amount of dust. We observed the different changes that happened when each parameter was changed.</p> </center>

<p><center>This is the 3.1.6 project in which Mark, Luke, and I organized the messy data set into four separate data sets. After we turned the data into graphs, we figured out that the data sets were from the Rocky Mountains environment in the Alien Planet.  In the rocky mountains, there are low temperatures that can heat up quickly, bright light that can be occasionally interrupted by clouds, and a low and constant flow of wind that gives off a steady sound level </center></p>
