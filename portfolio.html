<p> <center>This is a cookie-click game that I made in collaboration with Luca Rosano Doolittle. When you click on the moving cookie, you get a point for clicking it. After you get 20 cookies, you can purchase an automatic cookie clicker that will add 5 cookies for each rotation of the cookie. <br></br> If you have 100 cookies, you can purchase an automatic cookie clicker that will add 10 cookies for each rotation.</p>

<p> <center> This is a game that is based on the classic game "Fruit Ninja" where you cut fruit and get points for it. If you do not hit the fruit, you do not get the points.</p>

<p><center>This is our fishing game that I made with Luke Ferratt and Mark Paranjape. you can move the boat with arrow keys to collect the fish. The highest score I've seen is 51. good luck</p>

<p><center>In this project we searched a system for possible phishing. We also found corrupted files in the fish tank maintenance. We found errors in the magnesium and alkalinity levels, and the temperature was too high. </p>

<p><center> In this project RJ and I selected a simulation to observe and study from NetLogo. We decided on the Lighting simulation. This model showed how lightning works and how the negative ions from the clouds connect with the dust and trees on the ground. We could change the size of the cloud, its strength, the number of trees, and the amount of dust. We observed the different changes that happened when each parameter was changed.</p> </center>

<p><center>This is the 3.1.6 project in which Mark, Luke, and I organized the messy data set into four separate data sets. After we turned the data into graphs, we figured out that the data sets were from the Rocky Mountains environment in the Alien Planet.  In the rocky mountains, there are low temperatures that can heat up quickly, bright light that can be occasionally interrupted by clouds, and a low and constant flow of wind that gives off a steady sound level. After reviewing the correct answer, we were wrong in our assumption. We believed it to be the Rocky Mountain biome, but it was actually the Island Forrest biome. The part we were incorrect in was our labeling of the graphs. We has the temperature and light graphs switched and that impacted our decision greatly.  </center></p>

<p><center>This is our project that is about making meaning from data. We looked at honey production in different states like: Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. We measured High Tier Honey Producers, Mid Tier Honey Producers, and Low Tier Honey Producers. For us, it was hard to organize the data to create visuals, and to validate that the data collection algorithm we used was correct. Processing the data and seeing visualizations helped us to gain insight into the state of bee colonies in the US.</center></p>
