<center><p>In this project RJ and I selected a simulation to observe and study from NetLogo. We decided on the Lighting simulation. THis model showed how lightning works and how the negative ions from the clouds connect with the dust and trees on the ground. We could change the size of the cloud, strength, the number of trees, and the amount of dust. We observed the different changes that happened when each parameter was changed.  </p></center>
